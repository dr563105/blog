Hello welcome to my blog!

Before I introduce myself, please tell me how did you stumble into my blog? How
do you find the posts? Are they informative or hard to understand or boring/too long or
full of mistakes? Your feedback is important for me. Contact me here or via twitter. Love
to interact with you.

So, since you're curious about me, I'd happily tell a few things describing myself.

My name is Deepak Ramani. I'm an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer/Data Analyst.
I hold a Masters degree from RWTH Aachen University in Communications engineering. My
thesis was based on autonomous driving involving ROS. If you're interested you can read
about it [here](https://github.com/dr563105/basicad_framework).

Prior to going to Germany, I worked at Infosys Technologies for about two years. This was
a valuable experience for me to know how corporate, agile methodologies work.

I strive to improve myself on things I'm working on. I love feedback be it positive or
negative. Perhaps because of my upbringing, I enjoy working in a team that share my
ideologies and mentality to achieve goals with perfection.

I'm interested in bringing the power of machine learning to fields such as sports and see
how much impact it could have. Presently, I analyse *event data* from soccer after weekend matches.
I hope to publish a few here as posts in the next weeks.

At the moment I'm learning about *tracking data* and participating in the [NFL Health &
Safety](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-health-and-safety-helmet-assignment/overview) kaggle competition.

Due to Covid, I had to return to India. I am seeking full time employment starting immediately as a data scientist,
data analyst, or machine learning engineer preferably in Europe.  I'm open to relocation and if the situation necessitates I'm
happy to work remotely.

If you have interest in seeing my resume please contact me.

Und ich kann gerne auf Deutsch mit dir reden. Bitte schreib mir!
